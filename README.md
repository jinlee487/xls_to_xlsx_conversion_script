# xls_to_xlsx_conversion_script
### 👋 Introduction 

Hello World! 

At my work, one of my daily office task was to convert xls files to xlsx for other uses. I was so fed up with the menial task of opening up xls files just to save it as a new xlsx file on Excel. So I wrote up a Python script to simplify the process. 

### 📑 How to Install

The main idea is to simplify the process of converting xls files to xlsx.

Before:
You should download Jupyter Notebook, open the config file and edit the directory to the your specified directory:

```python
{
  "name": "xls_to_xlsx_conversion_script",
  "version": "1.00",
  "author": "Jin Woo Lee",
  "directory":"C:\\Users\\PC1\\Desktop\\라벨데이터\\라벨출력리스트"
}
```

After: 
run the program
